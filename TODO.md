- [ ] Refactor everything in functions and use '?' instead of unwrap()
- [ ] Return JSON errors with the API instead of crashing
- [ ] Rewrite everything with async/await (Rocket, reqwest, mongodb)
- [ ] Add delay between Nomics requests as it seems to hit a rate-limit with splitted requests after 2 requests (the 3rd fails)
- [ ] Lint the JavaScript
- [ ] Add authentication
- [ ] Handle errors client-side
- [ ] Send errors server-side (mongodb connection, rate limit, etc.)
